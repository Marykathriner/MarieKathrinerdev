	<h3 id="about" >About</h3>
	<p class="about">I'm a queer, SW friendly mostly self-taught web developer.<br>As an online Sex Worker myself I know that we often struggle to find people who are willing to work for and with us and respect us just as any other client.<br>So I started this business to develop link pages, portfolios, landing pages and simple websites for SWers and anyone else.

<!--FAQ-->
<div class="wrapper-faq">
<h3 id="faq">FAQ</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>E-Commerce</li>
			<li class="subli">I do NOT provide E-Commerce services so your fans can't pay you on your website they need to use a extern payment method!</li>
		<li>Pop-Up</li>
			<li class="subli"> We can make a Pop-up window that shows up when someone visits your page that ask the user for consent that they are 18+ or anything else you want the Pop-up to say.</li>
		<li>Explict content</li> 
			<li class="subli">Since there is no way of verifying the users age besides asking them I will not use any explicit content on your page. We can link your Adult platforms and use non explicit images in your Gallery.</li>
		<li>Payment methods</li>
			<li class="subli">PayPal, Bank transfer or Onlyfans tip (+20%)</li>
		<li>How to order</li>
		<li class="subli">1. Send me a DM on Telegram or an Email and let me know what kind of website you want me to build for you. If you already know it tell me what details and features you want to include. I don't have any "packages" every client becomes a customized website with the features they need.</li>
		<li class="subli">2. As soon as we figured out what features and details your page gonna have I can quote you a price. Those can vary from 20$ to even a 1000$ depending on the complexity and also the speed you need me to work.</li>
		<li class="subli">3. Next we figure out the general Mood board, color palette and the Content you want to put on the page(Text, pictures and links)</li>
		<li class="subli">4. I will show you my web design I made and if you like it I start coding. I will update you ASAP and give you a preview link so you can always see what in Realtime every time I commit a change even before we launched your website.</li>
